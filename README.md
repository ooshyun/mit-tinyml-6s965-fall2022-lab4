# mit-tinyml-6s965-fall2022-lab4
This repository is for lab 4 of MIT 6.S965 TinyML Fall 2022. The offical lab page is [here](https://hanlab.mit.edu/courses/2023-fall-65940) and lecture videos are [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL80kAHvQbh-ocildRaxjjBy6MR1ZsNCU7). At 2022, I follows their examples, but currenty [their github](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/tinyengine) do not give examples to test ON/OFF optimization techniques such as im2col. This contains their examples with ON/OFF optimization techniques in mit-tinyml-6s965-fall2022-lab4. The way to build is following the [documents](./MIT_Efficient_AI_Course_Lab_4_Deployment_on_MCU.pdf)
